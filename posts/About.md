# Hi, I'm Iestyn.

## I’m a designer and engineer based in London, working at [busuu](http://busuu.com). In my spare time I like to read, cook, and build stuff.

<small>It’s pronononced “yes-tin”, and is the Welsh form of Justin, in case you were wondering :)</small>

<!-- # About this site

When I was learning about all this web stuff, it was really hard to find out what were the best tools and techniques. Most websites don't say about how they were built and how they run, and that stuff can be gold dust to people trying to figure out all this stuff.

This post is made up of every useful detail I can think of about this site. It's all stuff that I would have found really useful in 2011...

## Development
I wrote every line of code using [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/). I've tried almost every code editor on the Mac and it's my favourite by far. I use Safari for browsing but Chrome for debugging as I know my way 'round it a bit better.

### Back-end
This site is powered by [poet](http://jsantell.github.io/poet/), a blog generator that runs on [express](http://expressjs.com/), a super-awesome node framework.

### Front-end
Using node means I can use the awesome [jade templating engine](http://jade-lang.com/), which makes writing HTML super quick. It's indentation-based (so it's impossible not miss a closing tag), and has all kinds of awesome functionality: template inheritance, mixins, functions, iteration...

Styles are written in [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), then compiled into CSS. Stylus is very similar to jade in that it's indentation based and super powerful; it also doesn't require you to use brackets and colons and stuff. I have a set of [stylus utilities](https://github.com/iest/stylus-start-utils/blob/master/util.styl) that I use on all my projects to help me get up and running faster.

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is an indispensable tool which I use *all* the time. If you don't know about grunt, it's a simple javascript-powered task runner. On this site I use it to [compile stylus](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-stylus) to CSS and to [watch for updated files](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) to live-reload the browser. However it can also be used for all kinds of stuff: from concatenating files together and minifying them, to optimising images and running bash scripts. It should be part of every front-ender's toolbox.

All the icons on the site are either svg (my logo) or part of an icon font that I generated on [Fontello](http://fontello.com/). I'm using the beautiful FF Tisa Pro for my body font, served by [Typekit](https://typekit.com/).

This page weighs in at around 137KB with an empty cache, 82KB of that being the external webfonts (so that's ~55KB of HTML, CSS, and JS). I could cut the CSS down a bit (as there's a few useless classes), but I'm happy with it overall.

## Hosting
The domain is registered at [Hover.com](https://www.hover.com), the nicest domain registrars I've found.

I'm hosting the site on a [Linode](http://linode.com) box. It was a pretty steep learning curve to figure out how to properly set up a web server, but it's totally worth it. I recently rebuilt the box and I'm now using [nginx](http://nginx.com) as a reverse proxy; it's fairly straight-forward to setup, and is super fast.

## Open source
